**Today's Progress**: Practicing CSS Grid

**Thoughts**: *Although grid layout can be tricky, I find it very convinient for some sort of 2D layout.*

**TODO**: Survey Form using Grid Layout

**CSS LEARNING PROGRESS** 
- [x] CSS Flex 
- [x] CSS Grid
- [x] Bootstrap
- [ ] SASS
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Transitions & Transforms
- [ ] Hamburger Menu


### Day 4: 7-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: I've practice SASS with node-sass. Nice change from `Prepros` app.


### Day 5-8: 8-11-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: I've practice SASS using **Live SASS Compiler** extension for VS Code. It seems that there is an issue with image url's, because it cannot display images at all. Unnecessary waste of time.


### Day 9: 12-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 
 - [x] Fixed sass errors in my project
 - [x] Learned how to use `node-sass`. Inside 
`package.json` file:

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "npm run --w"
 }
  ```
  Then run this command every time new project is made, or changes occured.


### Day 10 & 11: 13 & 14-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 

 - Working on Restaurant Site for the last 2 days
 
 **DONE**
 - [x] Navigation
 - [x] Hamburger Menu
 - [x] Gallery
 - [x] Footer
 
 **TODO**
 - [ ] Media Queries

### Day 12: 15-November-2019

**Today's Progress**:

I've finished responsive part of the Restaurant site. I included in my project:

- @mixin
- @extends
- @function

 **DONE**
 - [x] Media Queries

**Thoughts**: *Working with media queries is much simplier in pure CSS. With SASS, every element has it's own section with media queries, so the result is - media queries all over the place... Just my thoughts..*


### Day 13: 17-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 

I've learned:

- [x] SASS Data Types
- [x] SASS String Interpolation
- [x] SASS Loops (**for** loop and **each** loop) and
- [x] SASS Conditions (if directive)

**Thoughts**: Although the SASS can be very useful, especially when it comes to variables and functions, I find it somewhat robust with all partial files needed for one sass file that will finally render to CSS. Media queries are also hard to track because they should be placed inside the element. So far, SASS is not my favorite styling option.

### Day 14: 19-November-2019
