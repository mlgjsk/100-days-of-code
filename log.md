### Day 2:  5-November-2019


**Today's Progress**: Practicing CSS Grid

**Link(s) to work**: [Survey Form](https://codepen.io/simin_ana/pen/OGyQVY)

**CSS LEARNING PROGRESS** 
- [x] CSS Flex 
- [x] CSS Grid
- [x] Bootstrap
- [ ] SASS
- [ ] Animations
- [ ] Transitions & Transforms
- [ ] Hamburger Menu


### Day 4: 7-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: I've practice SASS with node-sass. Nice change from `Prepros` app.


### Day 5-8: 8-11-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: I've practice SASS using **Live SASS Compiler** extension for VS Code. It seems that there is an issue with image url's, because it cannot display images at all. Unnecessary waste of time.


### Day 9: 12-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 
 - [x] Fixed sass errors in my project
 - [x] Learned how to use `node-sass`. Inside 
`package.json` file:

```
"scripts": {
    "test": "npm run --w"
 }
  ```
  Then run this command every time new project is made, or changes occured.


### Day 10 & 11: 13 & 14-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 

 - Working on Restaurant Site for the last 2 days
 
 **DONE**
 - [x] Navigation
 - [x] Hamburger Menu
 - [x] Gallery
 - [x] Footer
 
 **TODO**
 - [ ] Media Queries

**Link to work:** [Restaurant Site](https://github.com/mlgjsk/Restaurant-Site)

### Day 12: 15-November-2019

**Today's Progress**:

I've finished responsive part of the Restaurant site. I included in my project:

- @mixin
- @extends
- @function

 **DONE**
 - [x] Media Queries

**Thoughts**: *Working with media queries is much simplier in pure CSS. With SASS, every element has it's own section with media queries, so the result is - media queries all over the place... Just my thoughts..*


### Day 13: 17-November-2019

**Today's Progress**: 

I've learned:

- [x] SASS Data Types
- [x] SASS String Interpolation
- [x] SASS Loops (**for** loop and **each** loop) and
- [x] SASS Conditions (if directive)
